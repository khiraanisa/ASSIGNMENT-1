## Reflection
From the advice of the ex-CTO of Clarity Techworks, no matter how well you do in your job, a bad attitude will not only waste our talent, but it will also ruin the whole community dynamic. This emphasizes while skills are important, they are not enough on their own. Without a great attitude, someoneâ€™s talent will be wasted and disrupt the group effort. To achieve success in this fast-paced era of technology, companies require strong soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and the ability to adapt to different conditions.

Other than that, self-learning and continuous improvement are important for anyone who desires success in this rapidly evolving technological world. We should not always rely on others for guidance, it is high time for us to embrace the challenges by taking a step out of our comfort zone. Since the competition keeps rising to surpass the limit, we are required to keep striving independently to achieve a great and successful career in the future. 

Lastly, communication and analytic thinking are also important in providing innovation and efficiency in IT-related jobs. These skills are essential for effective problem-solving for beginners as they need to survive in this technology-driven world which can be quite stressful.
